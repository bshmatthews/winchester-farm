            "Introduction": "A stranger?... Hello.#$e#Don't mind me. I just live out here alone.",
            "reject_869": "What do you have there? Looks like it would make good bait.$h",
            "cc_Boulder": "My old friend, the glimmering boulder, has moved on. It may not seem like an important event, but to me it's a big change.#$b#I'm happy for the old rock to see more of the world, though.$h",
            "MovieInvitation": "Oh... me? I usually wouldn't, but... okay. It's nice of you to think about me.#$b#I'll head over there in a little while.",
            "Mon": "The crisp air of the wilderness is all I care to know.#$e#I live out here by choice.",
            "Tue": "Please excuse my awkwardness. My \"people skills\" are rusty.",
            "Wed": "I don't know you well enough to trust you. Sorry.",
            "Thu": "I don't like conflict. I don’t fight anymore. I watch the bees.",
            "Fri": "Please don't destroy my tent.#$e#It's happened before.$s",
            "Sat": "I'm happy by myself, you know.#$e#I don't need new friends.",
            "Sun4": "Monkeys... are so clever, and they're sensible in that they leave the skins on the bananas that they eat. Is it really necessary to test cosmetics on them? I mean, how important is lipstick to you, @?",
            "Tue4": "There’s more to humanity than survival. You... look for purpose, and you must not be defeated by anger or despair. Or hedonism, for that matter.",
            "Wed6": "I spend a lot of time thinking.#$e#If you can fully understand the reasons behind your thoughts, you'll have reached a new level of being.",
            "Wed2": "'Why is 6 afraid of 7?' I assume it's because 7 is a prime number and prime numbers can be intimidating.",
            "Thu4": "The people here seem nice, but they avoid me.#$e#People are afraid of the unknown.$u",
            "Fri4": "You can learn a lot from trees.#$b#Spend time with them and they might tell you their secrets.#$e#Go in peace, young one.",
            "Sat4": "I have everything I need to survive, and more. Nature plays a wonderful tune if you can only learn to listen.#$e#I also spend a lot of time reading. One of the reasons I stopped in the valley was for the great library.",
            "Sun": "#$1 linusVandal#Someone was throwing rocks at my tent last night... I just had to wait it out.$s$k#$e#I don't like to stay in one place for too long. There's just too much to experience in the world.",
            "summer_Mon4": "During all these years I've discovered a few secrets about life.#$e#You'll have to find out for yourself.",
            "summer_Mon": "#$1 LinusHeron#I saw a heron wading gracefully through the morning mist. Such are the treasures of a quiet life.$k#$e#It's so easy to get caught up in the noise of modern life. Your best years will pass you by in a formless blur. That's why you'v got to learn to slow down. ",
            "summer_Tue4": "You don't have to be ruled by fate. You can choose freedom. And I still believe that's something worth fighting for.",
            "summer_Wed6": "We’re each a fragment of total perception — just one compartment in that dragonfly eye of group mind. The key to this total, shared perception — it’s surprisingly physical.",

            "fall_Tue4": "#$1 LinusFall1#Some joker sprayed paint all over my home during the night... It took hours to scrub it off this morning.$k#$e#I need to start gathering lumber for the winter.#$e#Do you have enough lumber to keep your house warm?",
            "fall_Wed4": "I don't have many responsibilities, so I spend my time thinking.#$e#You have to understand your thoughts before you can control them.",
            "fall_Sun": "Did you know that a cat’s penis is sharply barbed along its shaft? I know for a fact the females were not consulted about that.",
            "fall_Sun6": "You know, I’ve... I’ve been here for a very long time. And I remember many things. I remember being at a shoreline, watching a little grey fish heave itself up on the beach and an older brother saying, \"don’t step on that fish, Castiel. Big plans for that fish.\"$h",
            "winter_Mon": "It can get really cold if you live in a tent.$s",
            "winter_Tue4": "Thanks for not shunning me, @. It takes a lot of wisdom to override your base instincts.#$e#I'm a human like everyone else. I just have a different lifestyle.",
            "winter_Wed4": "I'm sure you understand why I'm cautious of strangers.#$e#But let's put that in the past, okay? You and I are friends now, I think.",
            "winter_Thu4": "Winter is tough, but you can still fish and forage to get by.#$e#If you have any animals you should keep them inside.",

            "winter_Sat4": "Thanks for stopping by. I was actually feeling a little lonely this morning.#$e#So, have you discovered anything interesting in the mines?",
            "winter_Sun": "Sleeping on the ground is good for my back.#$e#It's best to look at the positive side of things.$h"
