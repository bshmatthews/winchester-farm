# Heart Events

These are all of Linus's events, plus placeholders for higher-star events, since the NPC is now dateable.

## Zero Hearts

After you have 50 Friendship points with Linus, enter the town between 8pm - 12am on a day that's not raining. (This event cannot trigger before Spring 7, Year 1)

George will ask you to scare off some raccoons who are stealing from his trash cans. Instead, you discover ~~Linus~~ Castiel, who is extremely embarrassed, but explains that if he didn't eat the food, it would go to waste. You then get the option to tell him what you think about his actions. Note that none of the choices will affect friendship with ~~Linus~~ Castiel.

After you leave, he proceeds to try to steal from the Saloon's trash can, where he is caught by ~~Gus~~ Ellen, who gives him a meal saying that he doesn't want any villager to go hungry.

## Three Hearts

After reaching 3 hearts with ~~Linus~~ Castiel he will send you a Sashimi recipe in the mail.

> how are you doing? I've enclosed some instructions on how to make one of my favorite fish recipes.  
\- ~~Linus~~ Castiel

## Four Hearts

Enter the mountain area near his tent between 8pm - 12am on a day that's not raining.

~~Linus~~ Castiel will invite you over to his camp site. He will apologize for not trusting you when you first met, and thanks you for being a good friend. He invites you into his tent, where he shows you how to craft Wild Bait for use in fishing.

## Seven Hearts

After reaching seven hearts with ~~Linus~~ Castiel, he will send you a Fish taco recipe in the mail.

> how are you doing? I've enclosed some instructions on how to make one of my favorite fish recipes.  
\- ~~Linus~~ Castiel

## Eight Hearts

Exit Robin's house on a day that's not raining between 9am and 5pm.

Robin, ~~Linus~~ Castiel, and the player appear in front of Robin's house. Robin offers to make ~~Linus~~ Castiel lunch, but he refuses, saying "I've had great luck foraging today. * Robin turns toward the player and asks if they have something to say.

  * I'm just pleased that ~~Linus~~ Castiel is doing well... (+250 friendship with ~~Linus~~ Castiel.)
      * ~~Linus~~ Castiel thanks the player and adds that he was worried the player would ask him to move on to The Farm. He says that he appreciates the player's respect for his chosen way of life.
  * I'd like to invite ~~Linus~~ Castiel to live on the farm with me... (No effect on friendship.)
      * Robin becomes excited and offers to build "a real cozy house * for ~~Linus~~ Castiel. ~~Linus~~ Castiel refuses, saying that he appreciates the kindness, but he lives the way he does by choice. He prefers to live alone, in harmony with nature. He adds that he values his friendship with the player.

The cutscene ends as ~~Linus~~ Castiel runs off to pick berries.
