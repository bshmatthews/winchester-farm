# Heart Events

These are all of Linus's events, plus placeholders for higher-star events, since the NPC is now dateable.

## Zero Hearts

After you have 50 Friendship points with Linus, enter the town between 8pm - 12am on a day that's not raining. (This event cannot trigger before Spring 7, Year 1)

George will ask you to scare off some raccoons who are stealing from his trash cans. Instead, you discover ~~Linus~~ Castiel, who is extremely embarrassed, but explains that if he didn't eat the food, it would go to waste. You then get the option to tell him what you think about his actions. Note that none of the choices will affect friendship with ~~Linus~~ Castiel.

After you leave, he proceeds to try to steal from the Saloon's trash can, where he is caught by ~~Gus~~ Ellen, who gives him a meal saying that he doesn't want any villager to go hungry.

## Eight Hearts

Exit Robin's house on a day that's not raining between 9am and 5pm.

Robin, ~~Linus~~ Castiel, and the player appear in front of Robin's house. Robin offers to make ~~Linus~~ Castiel lunch, but he refuses, saying "I've had great luck foraging today. * Robin turns toward the player and asks if they have something to say.

  * I'm just pleased that ~~Linus~~ Castiel is doing well... (+250 friendship with ~~Linus~~ Castiel.)
      * ~~Linus~~ Castiel thanks the player and adds that he was worried the player would ask him to move on to The Farm. He says that he appreciates the player's respect for his chosen way of life.
  * I'd like to invite ~~Linus~~ Castiel to live on the farm with me... (No effect on friendship.)
      * Robin becomes excited and offers to build "a real cozy house * for ~~Linus~~ Castiel. ~~Linus~~ Castiel refuses, saying that he appreciates the kindness, but he lives the way he does by choice. He prefers to live alone, in harmony with nature. He adds that he values his friendship with the player.

The cutscene ends as ~~Linus~~ Castiel runs off to pick berries.

# Quotes

Below are all of Linus's dialog lines.

## First Meeting
 * "A stranger?... Hello. Don't mind me. I just live out here alone.”

## Regular
 * 	"The crisp air of the wilderness is all I care to know. I live out here by choice.”
 * 	"...Have you come to ridicule me? I'm just minding my own business.”
 * 	"I don't know you well enough to trust you. Sorry.”
 * 	"...Hmm? Do you want something from me?”
 * 	"Please don't destroy my tent. It's happened before.”
 * 	"I'm happy by myself, you know. I don't need new friends.”
 * 	"I have to be wary of strangers. Most people don't like a 'wild man'.”
 * 	"Someone was throwing rocks at my tent last night... I just had to wait it out.”
 * 	"I don't like to stay in one place for too long. There's just too much to experience in the world.”
 * 	"It would be nice if the townspeople could accept me for who I am. I like living out here in the open air. That's what they don't understand.”
 * 	"You can learn to survive in the wild. I have. I think we all have a hidden urge to return to nature. It's just a little scary to make the leap.”
 * 	"The people here seem nice, but they avoid me. People are afraid of the unknown.”
 * 	"You can learn a lot from trees. Spend time with them and they might tell you their secrets. Go in peace, young one.”
 * 	"I have everything I need to survive, and more. Nature plays a wonderful tune if you can only learn to listen. I also spend a lot of time reading. One of the reasons I stopped in the valley was for the great library.”

## After passing out in the Mines
 * 	"...I found you unconscious in the mines. You're lucky I happened to pass by! Be a little more careful next time, okay?”

## Rainy Day
 * 	"A warm rain is a pleasant way to get clean.”

### 6+ Hearts
 * 	"I spend a lot of time thinking. If you can fully understand the reasons behind your thoughts, you'll have reached a new level of being.”

## Summer
 * 	"I saw a heron wading gracefully through the morning mist. Such are the treasures of a quiet life.”
 * 	"It's so easy to get caught up in the noise of modern life. Your best years will pass you by in a formless blur. That's why you've got to learn to slow down.”
 * 	"This is an easier time of year for me. I don't have to worry about staying warm. Plus, the fruits of the wild are growing everywhere.”
 * 	"During all these years I've discovered a few secrets about life. You'll have to find out for yourself.”
 * 	"How have you been, my young friend?”
 * 	"I have my own reasons for living alone like this. Some things are best left unsaid... I should do some foraging.”
 * 	"Whenever you catch a fish, take a moment to thank it for its sacrifice. Even if you don't believe in the spirit of the fish, it's a good mental exercise. We need to be aware of our effect on the environment”
 * 	"You can find rainbow trout in streams right now.”

### 6+ Hearts
 * 	"... summer. The warm sun heats up the cans for me. Then at night I've got a warm meal to look forward to.”

## Fall
 * 	"I've explored deep into the caves. They hold some hidden secrets. Just be cautious if you go in there.”
 * 	"I don't like to stay in one place for too long.”
 * 	"Some joker sprayed paint all over my home during the night... It took hours to scrub it off this morning.”
 * 	"I need to start gathering lumber for the winter. Do you have enough lumber to keep your house warm?”
 * 	"I don't have many responsiblities, so I spend my time thinking. You have to understand your thoughts before you can control them.”

### 6+ Hearts
 * 	"There's nothing quite like a feast of wild mushrooms in the fall.”

## Winter
 * 	"It can get really cold if you live in a tent.”
 * 	"Sleeping on the ground is good for my back. It's best to look at the positive side of things.”
 * 	"Thanks for not shunning me, [Player]. It takes a lot of wisdom to override your base instincts. I'm a human like everyone else. I just have a different lifestyle.”
 * 	"I'm sure you understand why I'm cautious of strangers. But let's put that in the past, okay? You and I are friends now, I think.”
 * 	"Winter is tough, but you can still fish and forage to get by. If you have any animals you should keep them inside.”
 * 	"The trees go to sleep during the winter. It makes it a bit lonely out here. But I wouldn't deny them their beauty sleep.”
 * 	"Thanks for stopping by. I was actually feeling a little lonely this morning. So, have you discovered anything interesting in the mines?”
