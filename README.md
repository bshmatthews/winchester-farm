# Winchester Farm

This is a mod based on [bendingsignpost](https://bendingsignpost.tumblr.com)'s [Stardew Valley AU idea](https://bendingsignpost.tumblr.com/post/659639150496120832/au-stardew-valley).

# Goal and scope

The goal of this project is to add some Supernatural characters and concepts to Stardew Valley. 

The mod probably won't add new mechanics or storylines.

# Installation

1. Install [SMAPI](https://smapi.io/)
2. Install [ContentPatcher](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1915)
3. Download the ZIP file from this repository: click the green "Code" button and select "Download ZIP" from the dropdown menu
4. Put the "WinchesterFarm" directory in the Mods directory in your game folder

# Contributing 

I would love for this to be a collaborative project. There are many ways you can contribute:

* Submit feedback or ideas in the [Issues](https://github.com/bshmatthews/winchester-farm/issues) tab
* Draw pixel art
* Edit character data
* Write dialog or events
* Modify `content.json` to incorporate others' work

This mod uses [ContentPatcher](https://stardewcommunitywiki.com/Modding:Content_Patcher) which lets you change the game's content.

Since you'll base your content on content from the original game, you'll need to [unpack your Stardew files](
https://stardewcommunitywiki.com/Modding:Editing_XNB_files#Unpack_game_files) so you can view all the original dialog and data and art.

## Notes

The Notes directory will have a Markdown file for each replacement character. It also has a file that just lists all the [Mappings](notes/Mappings.md) between Stardew content and Supernatural.

## Art

In your unpacked game folder, you'll find the character portraits in the Portraits folder and the smaller character sprites in the Characters folder. 

You can contribute your art by making an Issue that links to your sprite sheet or by making a pull request that adds the sprite sheet.
